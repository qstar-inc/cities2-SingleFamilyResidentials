# Single Family Residentials
Tired of switch back and forth to zone between the different low density residential houses? With this mod you can do just that.

You can find the zone in the existing Residential tab in the Zoning menu.
You can find all the buildings separately on Find It or Add Objects menu as well.

# Asset Set Details
* Total Count: 351
* Zones: 1
* Buildings: 350
* UI priority: Residential Zone = 1
* Icons: Zone icon redesigned from vanilla NA Low Residential Zoning. Buildings icons from "Asset Icon Library".

# DISCLAIMER
* Mod idea by [Konsi / Mimonsi](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/authors/Mimonsi).
* Safe to remove. This mod will not break your save if removed. However the assets will no longer work.
* This mod may require ***Asset Packs Manager*** which is highly experimental. This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors. Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save. But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage. Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.
